In this reposityry, I have created a **simple Contact Adder** app using android studio 
Basic prototype in which
1. User can Dial directly by clicking call vector asset (which is clickable)
2. And user can add a temporary contact, just by clicking **Add contact button**
3. when Add contact button is clicked user is redirected to new activity which displays the basic information that user should enter
   (note : if user do not enter all the fields , Toast message will be displayed as warning (or) user directly clicks button the process will be canceled and user will be redirected to mainActivity)
4. when user enters all the fields and clicks save button, user will again redirected to main activity and data which user entered will be diaplayed in mainActivity and below that user will get option to call (or) see the location.
